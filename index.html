        <p class="main-content__about-me-description">
          I am a highly skilled Full Stack Developer with some experience in
          designing and developing modern web applications. My main focus is on
          creating robust and scalable solutions using a wide range of
          technologies, with particular expertise in Java, Python and
          JavaScript, both in the backend and in the integration of web
          technologies. My experience spans the entire development cycle, from
          architecture design to implementation and optimization of
          applications.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Backend Development (Java): I am
            an expert in Java, with deep knowledge of its applications in
            backend development. I have worked with frameworks such as Spring
            Boot and Hibernate, building secure, efficient, and maintainable
            applications. Frontend and Full
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stack Web Development:</strong> I have a broad knowledge of
            the web stack, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern
            frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. I also have experience
            integrating frontend systems with backend services, developing fully
            functional and optimized web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mathematics and Data Science:</strong> My strong
            understanding of mathematics and data science allows me to apply
            complex mathematical models to solve real-world problems, as well as
            implement machine learning algorithms and data analysis. I use tools
            like Python, and SQL to manipulate and analyze large data sets,
            generating useful insights for decision-making.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Software Architectures and Design Patterns:</strong> I
            apply software architectures such as microservices and layered
            architecture, and use design patterns like MVC, Singleton, Factory,
            Observer, among others, to ensure scalable and maintainable
            solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Application Security:</strong> I always consider security
            when developing applications, implementing practices like data
            encryption, handling authentication and authorization (including
            OAuth2 and JWT), and protecting applications against common
            vulnerabilities (such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protocols and Networking:</strong> I have a solid
            understanding of network protocols and communications, such as HTTP,
            TCP/IP, WebSockets, and RESTful APIs, which allows me to create
            applications that communicate efficiently and securely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design Knowledge:</strong> Although I am not a graphic
            designer by training, I have basic knowledge of web design and the
            creation of intuitive and responsive user interfaces. I use tools
            like Figma to prototype and collaborate on designing attractive user
            interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Professional Approach:</strong> My approach is always
            focused on quality, creating applications that are not only
            functional but also secure, scalable, and maintainable. Throughout
            my career, I have ensured to follow best practices in Agile
            development, continuous integration, and continuous deployment
            (CI/CD), and apply TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodologies to
            ensure robust and high-quality code.
